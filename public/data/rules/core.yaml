# Core Game Rules
# This file defines the fundamental mechanics of the boss battle system

turn_structure:
  phases:
    - player_phase
    - monster_phase
  description: >
    Each round consists of a Player Phase where all characters act,
    followed by a Monster Phase where the boss takes its actions.

movement:
  type: manhattan
  difficult_terrain_cost: 2
  description: >
    Movement is measured in tiles using Manhattan distance (no diagonals).
    Each point of Speed allows moving 1 tile. Difficult terrain costs
    2 movement to enter.

combat:
  attack_roll: null  # Currently auto-hit, roll damage directly
  damage_reduction: armor
  description: >
    Attacks automatically hit. Roll damage dice and subtract the target's
    Armor value. Minimum damage is 0.

actions:
  per_turn:
    move: 1
    action: 1
  description: >
    Each character may Move once and take one Action per turn.
    Actions include: Attack, Use Ability, or Interact.

conditions:
  staggered:
    name: Staggered
    effect: "Cannot take Actions until end of next turn"
    duration: "1 turn"

  prone:
    name: Prone
    effect: "Movement costs doubled. Melee attacks against you have advantage."
    duration: "Until you spend movement to stand"

  burning:
    name: Burning
    effect: "Take 1d4 damage at the start of your turn"
    duration: "Until extinguished (action) or 3 turns"

  enraged:
    name: Enraged
    effect: "+2 damage to all attacks, -1 Armor"
    duration: "Until end of combat"

  bleeding:
    name: Bleeding
    effect: "Take 1 damage at the start of your turn"
    duration: "Until healed or 5 turns"

rulebook_notes: >
  The core loop is simple: players coordinate their movements and attacks
  to whittle down the boss while avoiding its devastating attacks.
  Positioning is key - being in the wrong place when the boss attacks
  can be fatal.
